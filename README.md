## Speeduino v0.4.X adapter for OBD1 vehicles

This repo is dedicated for an adapter to Honda OBD1 (civic MA/MB and probably MC // british made Civic. maybe also PNP for japan made ones like eg/ek with adapter) PnP connector to interface with speeduino 0.4.X.
This project was made in altium designer, might one day put it in kicad but i dont really have the skills in kicad yet for it. in a bit i will upload the Gerber files.

- In this PCB, its used the "OBD1" 64pin connector PN:174518-7.
- There will be wideband connector pins, and place for a wideband controller, where you will be able to use the stock O2 sensor OR the wideband.

## The pin names will be based on this schema.
