## Speeduino v0.4.X adapter for OBD1 vehicles

This repo is dedicated for an adapter with two modes: Honda OBD1 (civic MA/MB and probably MC) PnP connector, and Breakout Board for other vehicles.
This project was made in altium designer, might one day put it in kicad but i dont really have the skills in kicad for it. in a bit i will upload the Gerber files.

The pin names will be based on this schema.
